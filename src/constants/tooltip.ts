  "The number of planets you can observe depends on the diameter of the HWO telescope. Increase the diameter to see more planets! In fact, most of what you are currently seeing are host stars, not exoplanets. To observe a planet, its SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) must be greater than 5, and its ES max value must be larger than the distance to the planet from the HWO. Only planets that meet these conditions and have been discovered through imaging methods can be observed alongside their host stars. Move the telescope around to find these exoplanets!";
